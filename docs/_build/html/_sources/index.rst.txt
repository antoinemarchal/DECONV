IViS

**IViS** â€” Interferometric Visibility-space Inversion Software

IViS is a fast, GPU-accelerated non-linear deconvolution tool for radio interferometry, scalable to large mosaics and hyperspectral cubes.

.. note::

   In its current implementation, IViS is a generic MEM-like mosaicking framework, but it aims to incorporate arbitrary spectral models in the near future to fully exploit the spectral dimension of the data.

- `Documentation <https://ivis.readthedocs.io>`_

.. note::
   
   Parts of this code were inspired by the `MPol <https://github.com/MPoL-dev/MPoL>`_ package,
   which implements a Regularized Maximum Likelihood (RML) framework for radio interferometric imaging without mosaicking.

Installation
------------

To get started, we recommend using `mamba` to create a clean environment with `casacore`:

.. code-block:: bash

   mamba create -n casacore python=3.10 casacore python-casacore
   mamba activate casacore

Then install the latest development version of **IViS** directly from GitHub:

.. code-block:: bash

   pip install git+https://github.com/antoinemarchal/ivis.git
